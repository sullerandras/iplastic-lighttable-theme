##iplastic Light Table | Theme
Light background theme based on Sublime's iPlastic color scheme.

###Motivation

- I prefer light background over dark background, simply because most of the applications use light background and swithching between them and LightTable hurts my eyes
- the courier font is just ugly. I prefer [Menlo](https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/menlo). You probably need to install this font if you are not on Mac OS X.

##Known issues

- the Rainbow plugin's colors are not compatible with light background so you need to uninstall that.
